# [14 of 57] Tax Calculator

### Problem Statement:

Write a simple program to compute the tax on an order amount. The program should prompt for the order amount and the state. If the state is "WI", then the order must be charged 5.5% tax. The program should display the subtotal, tax, and total for Wisonsin residents but display just the total for non-residents.

### Example Output:

            What is the order amount? 10
            What is the stae? WI
            The subtotal is $10.00.

            The total is $10.55.
    
        Or

### Constraints:

* Implement this program using only a simple *if* statement â€” don't use an *else* clause.
* Ensure that all money is rounded up to the nearest cent.
* Use a single output statement at the end of the program to display the program results.
