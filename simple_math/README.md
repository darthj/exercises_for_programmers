### Problem Statement:
Write a program that prompts for two numbers. Print the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the numbers as shown in the example output.

        Nouns:
        - numbers
        - sum
        - difference
        - product
        - quotient
        
        Verbs:
        - prompts

### Example Output:

    What is the first number? 10
    What is the second number? 5
    10 + 5 = 15
    10 - 5 = 5
    10 * 5 = 50
    10 / 5 = 2
